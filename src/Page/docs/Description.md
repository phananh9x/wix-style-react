Page component provides layout for a page header and content.
Features include:

- Vertical & horizontal scrolling
- Minimized header overlay (when vertically scrolled)
- Sticky content

#### Page Container

When using the `Page` component it container (PageContainer) should have a determined height (e.g. `height: 500px`, `height: 100vh`) otherwise, vertical scroll won't work.

> The above applies only when setting `upgrade` prop to `true`. (New Layout API)

#### Gradient
